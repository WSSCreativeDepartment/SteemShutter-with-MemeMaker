# SteemShutter-with-MemeMaker by dumar022
Simple camera app with Meme Maker inspired by Steem Blockchain


### Simple Camera app for iOS devices.
It takes best from your hardware and with great stabilization makes photos quick and easy. Flash device is manual only, but focus mode an be set as auto-foucus or manual by tapping on your screen. Selfie camera also included, yo can switch from back to front camera and the opposite by tapping on the same button. 

### Signature Creator
SteemShutter comes with Signature Creator. You can type your Steem username and choose one of the eight fonts. our signature will appear on the left-bottom corner of your photos along with the Steem logo. Your signature will remain saved in your app until you change it. 

### Meme Maker
New versions of SteemShutter have Meme Maker included. Simply add a photo from your photo library and add some text in the top text field and the bottom text field, choose one of the coolest fonts and you have a MEME. If you don't like it, click back and change it. Than save it to your photo library.  You can add any photo from your gallery to this Meme Maker, but I recommend those taken wit SteemShutter because I left some space down for the signature.

### Filters
When you make a photo, you can edit them using CG Filters. I you can add a filter over a filter and get completely new effects. Save your photo to your iPhone's photo library. 

### Cropping
Now you can crop your images by pinch gesture using two fingers. It is only possible for photos taken with SteemShutter.

### Colors
Version 1.8 brings six colors for sgnature and meme letters. Just tap on one of them at the bottom of your screen. 

### Reduced size
Steemit blog has 800 width, I think that busy.org is just a little bit wider. So why taking large photo if you do it for your blogging? Photo size reduced, SteemShutter saves your phone's memory by saving photos with width: 1000.
